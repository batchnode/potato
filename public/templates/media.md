# Managing Media

The **Media Library** is your central hub for images, PDFs, and other assets.

### 1. The Git Workflow
When you upload an image, it is pushed directly to your GitHub repository in the `assetsDir` you specified during setup.

### 2. Using Images in Posts
There are three ways to add images:
- **Upload:** Use the upload icon in the toolbar to pick a file from your computer.
- **Library:** Use the "Image Plus" icon to browse your existing GitHub assets without leaving the editor.
- **Link:** Use the standard image icon if you already know the path.

### 3. Authenticated Previews
Potato uses a secure proxy to show you previews of images stored in **Private Repositories**. This ensures your content stays private while you work on it.
