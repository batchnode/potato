# The Potato Workbench

Welcome to your central workspace! The Workbench is designed for content that isn't quite ready for the world.

### 1. What are Drafts?
Any content saved from the editor with the "Save Draft" button (or by editors with review restrictions) lands here in `_drafts`.

### 2. The Review Workflow
If you see articles here submitted by your team, it means they are waiting for an **Administrator** to:
- Review the content.
- Check the frontmatter.
- Click **Approve & Publish** to move it to the production folder.

### 3. Local Autosave
Potato automatically saves your work to your browser's cache every few seconds. Even if you don't click "Save," your work is likely safe!

*Tip: You can delete these guide files once your team is comfortable with the workflow.*
